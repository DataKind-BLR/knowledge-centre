DataKind brings high-impact organizations together with leading data scientists to use data science in the service of humanity. From one-hour events to year-long engagements, we have designed programs that enable data scientists and social changemakers to address tough humanitarian challenges together. Our work helps organizations develop evidence-based decision making, increase efficiency, and enhance their data literacy. It also introduces data scientists to the Data-for-Good movement and shows them how valuable their skills can be.
